Under my supervision, he managed to successfully complete all the projects I assigned to him, with competence and good humor. He has real and proven skills in the field of digital ergonomics, and his technical skills in jQuery, Zepto, Grunt, etc. no longer need to be demonstrated. He was also able to understand, as a Scrum Master, Agile methodologies and successfully implement them in the team he was responsible for (5 people). To summarize, he was a pleasant, available, motivated, competent, and always proactive collaborator."

Nevertheless, he quickly adapted to the team structure and different projects as well as to the work processes, and was able to make the right technical decisions on new projects and manage the team as best as possible despite turnover. Chechu is therefore someone who knows how to handle pressure and assert himself on delicate decisions, while remaining humble and close to the people he manages."
